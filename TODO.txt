Features:
- try-upgrade:
  - refactor getting the full dump into a different file - usually, we want to 
    get the dump once and tune/try diff.sql many times
  - improve error reporting
- anyone opening a SSH channel must make sure it's closed on (exceptional) exit
- before running pg_dump or psql, touch the port to see someone is listening
- Postgres control script

Refactoring: 
- move getting $DIR to a common location
- move utils.sh to a subfolder, move config.sh and environments.conf* to conf/
- config.sh might want to discover the locations of those commands on its own
