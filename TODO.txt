Features:
- master table diff: 
  - DB diff could download the full dumps
    - perhaps APGdiff works on a full dump, too?
  - then just grep "INSERT INTO \"C_" (or whatever the prefix in config.sh is)
    and use it as the status of master tables
- try-upgrade: improve error reporting
- Postgres control script

Refactoring: 
- move getting $DIR to a common location
- create config.sh.example
- move utils.sh to a subfolder, move config.sh and environments.conf* to conf/
- config.sh might want to discover the locations of those commands on its own
- split utils.sh into DB and rest
- harden everything
  - if the argument should be a file, check it really exists and can be read
  - anyone opening a SSH channel must make sure it's closed on (exceptional) exit
  - before running pg_dump or psql, touch the port to see someone is listening
