Features:
- master table diff: 
  - DB diff could download the full dumps
    - perhaps APGdiff works on a full dump, too?
  - then just grep "INSERT INTO \"C_" (or whatever the prefix in config.sh is)
    and use it as the status of master tables
- try-upgrade: improve error reporting
- db-diff: if there is no change, say something
- Postgres control script

Refactoring:
- rename scripts to noun-verb.sh
- move getting $DIR to a common location
- config.sh might want to discover the locations of those commands on its own
- harden everything
  - if the argument should be a file, check it really exists and can be read
  - if the argument should be an environment, check it is defined
  - if there are 2 environment arguments, make sure they are different
  - anyone opening a SSH channel must make sure it's closed on (exceptional) exit
  - before running pg_dump or psql, touch the port to see someone is listening
