Features:
- check if APGdiff works on full dump. If yes, then use the schema portion for 
  schema diff and C_ for master tables.
- try-upgrade: improve error reporting
- db-diff: if there is no change, say something
- Postgres control script
- cleanup script - just deletes work/
- script to actually apply the SQL patch to a remote DB
- Script parameters: 
  - Autocomplete environments
  - Currently we have script.sh env other... how about script.sh other env?
    Makes a bit more sense, it's like verb what where...

Refactoring:
- rename scripts to noun-verb.sh
- move getting $DIR to a common location
- config.sh might want to discover the locations of those commands on its own
- harden everything
  - if the argument should be a file, check it really exists and can be read
  - if the argument should be an environment, check it is defined
  - if there are 2 environment arguments, make sure they are different
  - anyone opening a SSH channel must make sure it's closed on (exceptional) exit
  - before running pg_dump or psql, touch the port to see someone is listening
  - if we write to work/, make sure it exists first
